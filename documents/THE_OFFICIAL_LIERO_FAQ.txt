LieroGuide information

1. What is LieroGuide?
What is LieroGuide?
LieroGuide is a Guide/FAQ to the game Liero, made by Joosa Riekkinen
joosa@mbnet.fi. This is the OFFICIAL FAQ. Also at the time of this Guide being
written Joosa was not communicating with the Liero community much. Almost all
Liero related material was being ignored by Joosa. There was some speculation
on the Lieronet forum that he had been hit by a bus on the way to work one
morning, or had fallen victim to the SCREAM killer. Although when I email him,
he replied quite happily. But he has got to be busy, so do NOT expect a reply
if you do send him mail.

LieroGuide is as complete as I could get it. From Basic info on Liero, to the
Weapon Guide, to Advanced strategies, to Clan info and Utilities to download.
Everything I could scrounge up on the game is in this Guide. If you see
anything missing, or have just made/discovered something for Liero, visit the
Contributing section.

Liero Information

2. What is Liero?
Liero is a popular DOS action/strategy game loosely based on the game Worms by
Team17. In Liero, you are one worm pitched into battle with another worm. There
is no surrender, mercy or other such insignificant details. This is a
winner-take-all situation. You have 40 weapons to initially choose from, and
you can carry 5 into battle, so you must choose wisely. Weapon descriptions are
found in the Weapons section. To survive, you must be quick and decisive, and
quick on the trigger finger. This game is unlike Worms by Team 17 in that there
is no 'turns', it is full-on real-time battle. There are 4 modes of play to
choose from: Kill'em all, Game of tag, Capture the flag, Simple Capture the
flag. More on these modes of play in the Different modes of play section. There
is also the ability to dig through dirt and use a ninja rope 'built into' your
worm (you don’t need to have anything special). The Ninja rope is a great tool,
if wielded properly. The Ninja rope can also latch onto your opponent, and drag
him toward you. This is a good way to say hello, and make sure every pellet of
your shotgun hits them. The game may not be up to todays standard (Voodoo 7,
P4-1000, 128 MB RAM), this game can run on a 486! But it provides hours of
entertainment if you have a friend, or if you like playing the CPU. There is a
CPU available, but its likes to shoot weapons like a nuke into a wall so it
bounces back and kills itself. Is still fun if you like moving target practice.


2.1 What is Liero's specifications?
Here are the Minimum and Recommended system requirements as stated in the
ReadmeEng.txt file in the Liero ZIP file.

2.7 How do I cheat in Liero?
You don’t. There are no cheat codes. You don’t need to, either. Set loading
times to 0 for unlimited ammo. Change your health to 10000% for (basically)
invulnerability. The CPU is easy to beat anyway. And if you want more, just
download some editors and edit the game. Its highly editable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options
3. Liero's Options
Here is a list of the options you can change in Liero and their effect on the
game.

3.1 Game mode
You can choose between 4 game modes. These include

Kill'em all  Basic 1-on-1 deathmatch. You can change how many frags (kills) to
win (see the section on Lives/Time to loose/Flags to win)


Game of tag  The one who gets killed first becomes "it". Both players have in
addition to the kills and lives meters a timer which shows the time spent as
"it". The player whose time is running is "it". Everytime you die, you become
"it", so try to stay alive... When the numbers are green you're winning (you've
been less time as "it"); when they're red you're losing.


Capture the flag  The one who kills the other player first may begin collecting
flags. As "the collector" you have to take as many flags as you need to win
(can be changed) to your "home base", a little cabin painted with the colour of
your worm located somewhere on the level. When the collector gets killed the
other worm becomes the new collector. If you're carrying a flag when you die,
the flag drops off.


Simple Capture the flag  Same as above, but there is no 'collector'. Both
players may begin capturing flags and returning them to their home base.


3.2 Lives/Time to loose/Flags to win
This section changes with different gameplays
Kill'em all
In Kill'em all, this section is how many lives you have. When you run out, you
loose.
Game of tag
In a Game of tag, this section is the Time to loose. When your clock reaches
this time, you loose and the other person wins.
Capture the flag/Simple Capture the flag
In Capture the flag/Simple Capture the flag, when somebody captures this number
of flags, they win.

3.3 Loading times
This is how fast your weapons reload, as a percentage out of 100%. Loading
times of 20% or less are very fast games, and loading times of 0% are complete
mayhem. (Especially with Nukes or Chiquita's)

3.4 Max bonuses
As far as I can gather, this option determines how many crates can appear on
the battlefield at one time. However, it does not appear to function.

3.5 Names of Bonuses
When on, all the bonuses that appear during gameplay will have a name above
them saying which weapon they contain. Note that booby crates will still
appear, and will have the name of a weapon above them, so they are
indistinguishable from normal crates.

3.6 Map
When on, a small minimap will appear underneath gameplay screens, showing a
small display of the battlefield.

3.7 Amount of blood
This is the amount of blood liero produces in percent. You can have up to 500%
blood, and there is a utility available for download (see the Utilities
section) to have up to 32750%. However, having your blood setting at 32750%
slows down the game a lot when hit with a powerful weapon.

3.8 Level
This is the level that is currently selected. Pressing enter on this will take
you to a menu of levels available. The level [Random] is just a random level
Liero generates every time you play on it. You can make your own level by using
the level editor provided with Liero or get some leveleditors in the
Leveleditors section, or just download levels (included in the levels section)

3.9 Regenerate level
If you are playing on a random level with this on, Liero will regenerate the
random level each time you play. Otherwise, it wont.

3.10 Shadows
If the shadows are on, during gameplay most things will cast a shadow on the
background. Depending on the colour of the land, the shade on the background
will be different.

3.11 Screen sync
From what I can tell, if screen sync is on, it slows the frames to a normal
speed (for fast computers) on slow computers it wont make much of a difference.

3.12 Load+Change
If Load+change is on, you will be able to switch weapons while one is loading.
If load+change is off, you will have to wait until the weapon has loaded,
leaving you unarmed in the interim. NOTE: A weapon will only reload if it is
selected.

3.13 Player 1 Options/Player2 Options
This takes you to a menu where you can change the player options. They are as
follows

3.13.1 Name
This is your name. Simple. If you dont type in a name, a random one is
generated from the names.dat file. If you press Ctrl and a letter you can get
weird letters.

3.13.2 Red/Green/Blue
These sliding bars show you how much Red/Green/Blue are being used to determine
your worm's colour. The more of a colour, the stronger that colour is in the
overall colour. Makes sense? I hope so. Its just like mixing paint in art. You
did do art, right? The current colour that will be used for your worm is
displayed in the bars, and the worm picture left of the options

3.13.3 Aim Up/Down - Move Left/Right - Jump - Change weapon - Fire
Determines which keys are used in gameplay for this option. Move to the option
you want to change, and press Enter. Liero will wait for you to press the key
you want to use in the game for that option.

3.13.4 Controller
Determines wether this worm is controlled by a human at the keyboard, or the
CPU. The CPU isn’t very smart. OK, it just likes to kill itself. Good for
moving target practice and Sniping practice. The computer is controlled by
random numbers, so its behavior is nearly all totally random. The only thing it
does constantly is walk toward you (until it reaches a certain position) is
walk toward you and ignore powerup's

3.14 Weapon options
This takes you to another sub-menu, displaying all the weapons in the game. If
a weapon's availability is menu, you can access it through the menu, and crates
dropped throughout the game. If it is set at bonus, that weapon will only
appear in crates dropped in the game. If it is set at banned, that weapon will
not come into play. Also if you ban all the weapons, a note will pop up and
tell you that you have to have at least one available.

Weapons
4. Liero Weapons
There are 40 different weapons in Liero, from the shotgun to the gauss gun,
grenade to large nuke. This page is to give you a good idea of the weapons
before you dive head-first into play with a large nuke and a itchy
trigger-finger.
4.1 Weapon types
All weapons fall into 4 basic categories. Projectile, Grenade, Defensive and
Bouncy
4.1.1 Projectile
Projectile weapons, the basis of just about all war involving weapons. Weapons
of this type do their damage by firing one, or a number of projectiles in the
general direction you are aiming. They then cause damage by exploding, or just
damage by hitting the worm.
Some examples of this type are: Shotgun, Gauss gun, Rifle.
Total weapons in this category: 19
4.1.2 Grenade
Grenade type weapons are weapons that involve an object (usually round) being
thrown in the direction you are aiming. They usually have a fuse, so they
(sometimes) have time to settle before exploding. They usually travel in an
arc, so they are useful for 'lobbing' over an object (to get at a worm hiding
behind a rock, for example). If throw down a tunnel straight, can travel a fair
distance before exploding (depending on the angle of the tunnel). If you throw
one of these down a tunnel, not quite paraell to it, they can bounce of each
side of the tunnel and stop close to your worm. It pays to line it up properly,
especially when your playing with dangerous ones.
Some examples are: Chiquita bomb, (Big/Mini) Nuke, Grenade
Total weapons in this category: 11
4.1.3 Defensive
Defensive weapons dont have a particular group. They can range from the fan,
which blows things away from your worm, to mines which are thrown like a
grenade, but blend into the terrain.
Some examples of this type are: Fan, Mine, Booby Trap
Total weapons in this category: 6
4.1.4 Bouncy
Bouncy weapons are weapons that dont explode on contact with ground, they
bounce. These weapons can be great to get hiding worms, but are also great at
getting yourself killed if you dont move, and then they still might. These
weapons require great skill to use effectively.
Some examples are: Zimm, Bouncy mine, Rb Rampage
Total weapons in this category: 4
4.2 Weapon descriptions
Here is the big bit. Descriptions of weapons, properties, pros/cons, uses. I am
not going to rate them, because the rating would be my own personal opinion,
which dosnt count much in this guide. You decide on your favorite. Weapons will
be categorized in the above categories, and in alphabetical order within their
own category.

Strategies
5. Liero Strategies
Here are the strategies I have so far for the game Liero. There split into
three categories - Easy, Medium and Hard
5.1 Easy strategies
5.1.1 Digging
Digging is one of the main aspects of the game. Some of you may not know how to
dig, so heres how. To dig, Hold down the key corresponding to the way you want
to dig, and rapidly press and release the opposite directional key. It is
important to be able to dig rapidly and easily.
5.1.2 Ninja roping
Ninja roping is also one of the most important things to learn in Liero. To use
the ninja rope, hold down the change weapon key and the jump key at the same
time. This will fire the ninja rope in the direction you are aiming. Get used
to ninja roping and practice it. It is a key element in the game.
5.1.3 Lay traps
Lay traps where you can, then hope your opponent hits them. Lay mines down a
tunnel, but remember where you put them. A good trap is to 'plant' bouncy mines
in the dirt by walking up right to the wall you want to plant them in and fire.
The bouncy mine will be stuck in the dirt, bouncing back and forth with nowhere
to go. then put a mine on top of this, not in the dirt. When the enemy comes by
and hits the mine, it will blow the bouncy mines out of the ground and they
will bounce all over the place. In a confined space, most of them will ht the
enemy while he is trying to flee. This can be done with all kinds of weapons.
5.2 Medium strategies
5.2.1 Big nuke/greenball combo
If the enemy is in the corner, fire a nuke so it is right next to them and
greenball them in the corner. The nuke will explode and all the nuke stuff will
be stuck next to the enemy. Then when the nuke stuff explodes, it will all hit
the enemy.
5.3 Hard strategies
5.3.1 Dart/Fan
Shoot the dart and when it passes through the enemy worm, blow them back into
the dart with the fan. It will do more damage each time you do.
5.4 Real-life tips
This is a section I dont think that has been incorporated into a game FAQ
before. Just because Liero isnt real dosent mean there are no real-life aspects
of strategies. Most of these tactics can be applied to all games and real-life
too.
5.4.1 Silence is your friend
I had a friend who, when he went to throw a chiquita right on my head, felt
compulsed to shout "CHIQUITA" just before he did. Even now when I mention
Liero, he shouts "CHIQUITA" for no apparent reason. But the upshot was, I was
out of there before he pushed the fire button. Moral of this story. DO NOT say
what you are about to do. Any good player will get their butt (If they value
it) out of the area and probably even spray some fire back at you while they
flee. In real life, do assassins say to their intended victims "I’m going to
kill you with a sniper rifle tomorrow, at 4:56 PM sharp"? NO. So in real-life
and in a battle of some kind, dont say a word. They may be able to know what
you are thinking, and fighting against a silent person can be disconcerting. Of
course, this can be used to trap even the expert player (unless their
paranoid), as described in the next section.
5.4.2 Shouting can also be your friend
Now, if my friend from the topic above was half-smart (yeah, right!), he would
do the following. plant some mines or a chiquita bomb near an entrance, get to
the other side and shout "CHIQUITA". I would have then done the smart thing -
Get the hell outta there. I would have then ran straight into the trap he
planted and possibly died. This tactic is sneaky and on a smart player could
only be used once. After falling for a trap like that, most people would just
shoot at the enemy rather than flee.
5.4.3 Conter-acting Shouting strategy
How do you stop falling for the trap above? Either be paranoid and second guess
their every move, or just ignore everything they say completely. The first
tactic is good in that it can counter-act most strategies, the downside is that
you can also fall for traps easier. The second is good as in that it will
counter-act this one, the downside is that you wont have that info on what
their doing.
5.4.4 Be unpredictable
Another all round tip. Be unpredictable. Trying to hit an erratic target is
harder than a predictable one. So dont always take the same path. Dont always
get the health. Dont always use the ninja rope. Be erratic as possible and be
spontaneous.
5.4.5 The beserker
If all else fails and you dont care much about fair play, honor or glory, do
the bezerker. Push your enemy out of their chair and line up your shot. Of
course they wont play you again. Or if you really are angry, Quit the game. Or
rip the plug out of the wall. Smash the monitor if you have to. Please note
that if you do this, you will be dishonorable, scum, too wound-up about a
little game, and up for the bill. If you do any of these tactics I dont want to
know you (Even knocking somebody out of their chair is bad)
5.5 Tricks
Tricks you can to with Liero. Play dead... Good worm...
5.5.1 Choose CPU's weapons for it
To choose the CPU's weapons for it, Start a two player game. Choose the second
players weapons as what you want the CPU's to be. When in the game, change the
second player to CPU. You can make the CPU a deadly opponent with a few
dangerous weapons...
5.5.2 Dual CPU
To make two CPU's fight to the death, simply set both players to CPU. Even use
the trick about to give them certain weapons. Mabey even have bets on which one
will win.
5.5.3 Real Splitscreen
Put a piece of cardboard on the splitscreen line and tape it onto the monitor.
Now you can sneak up behind people, etc.


5.5.4 Split vision
Keep one eye on your screen and one on the opponents. That way you can predict
the 3-4 next moves your enemy will/might make. Not very honest, but it's

Utilities
6. Liero utilities
There are a few Utilities that are available for Liero. Fortunately it is a
highly editable game and most of the editors are fairly user-friendly
6.1 Liero Blood Increaser
Need more blood for Liero? Then this is definitely for you. With this utility
you can increase the blood level in Liero up to 32750%. A hit with a tiny
weapon will now make you worm bleed heaps. Only problem with having blood at
32570% is that when hit with a powerful weapon like a gauss gun my P II-300
slows down bigtime while it tries to display all the particles of blood. Try to
keep it not too high or you will experience a bit of slowdown.

editors, CPU editor, Mods activator, etc. Make your own weapon, change that
stupid CPU, make new objects, change gravity, and if you cant be bothered, just
download some Mods of the net and activate them in LieroKit.

Clans
8. Liero clans
Here is a description and webpage for all the clans avaliable to Liero. Ive
contacted all the authors of the clans to get their section how theyd like it.
8.1 Terror Sabbath
Well, Terror Sabbath. One of the first clans I heard of, and the first to get
in contact with. Definatly worth a look. A pretty large clan with nice web-site
History
Very interesting part of the clan. This is just a more compact version I have
written based on the full story (which can be found on the Terror Sabbath
web-site)

Once upon a time, err ok. A little while ago (well, a long time) a guy(Johan)
asked his cousin over to stay for a while. After a bit of mucking round on the
net they decided to try out this game, Liero. What the heck is that?, Johan
thought. So they downloaded it and played it a bit and discovered it was quite
addictive. He then found out about the level editor and found it ok for his
needs. They then searched for more Liero on the web and found this old clan
called After Ski. Then the found a level called 'The base', and the supposed
announcment of Liero 2. It wasnt real, of course, but it got them thinking...
of making their own Liero Clan? His cousin was sceptical but never-the-less
Johan had still written a web-site about Liero. Not alot of activity happend.
Not a lot at all. Then one person joined... Then another. Then 2, then 3,
then.... well, you know what happend next. Next thing on the agenda was to...
get important people to join. Sander de Jong, yep, he joined. Problem solved.
The clan kept building and building...
What it is today
A big clan. No kidding. Nice clean web-page, nice layout. Big site with plenty
of info, downloads, etc.
What it is tommorow
A bigger clan. Ulvhockey's vision for the future is a Liero 2 with internet
play. Basically then Terror Sabbath would lunge headfirst into battle with
other clans. He would 'split' the clan into squads who would operate
independantly, taking orders from the clan leader. The squad would be lead by
the Squadleader, than working together as a group, knowing each other's
tactics/strategies. Then Terror Sabbath would slowly take over the world! (We
all knew he was really going for world domination all along)

its own Liero 2 sequel, messages within the clan for memebers, etc. Due to

Liero 2 Information
10. Liero 2 Information
This is where the information on all the Liero 2 projects are.
10.1 The official Liero 2
The official Liero 2 was announced by Joosa (The maker of Liero) on the
26/10/2000, then, when asked later if he was making it, the reply was 'not
right now'. So we wait and hope...
10.2 RageSquads Liero Sequel
Here is a little info on the RageSquad Liero 2 Sequel

More info about WinLiero:
* Fully customizable views (One fullscreen view or two at the bottom and one
large at the top or whatever you like!)
* Compound materials in the levels (You set flags like weapon-pass, worm-pass,
destroyable and so on to make your own materials).
* Any map size (They must be larger than the screen of course).
* 640x480 resolution.
* Tile technology and Level compression makes levels small and possible to
transfer to other when playing over a network or the Internet.
* Network / Internet play will be added a little later because the code is a
bit complicated.
* Support for MOD, XM, S3M, MP3 and other formats (I use FMOD!!!).
* As many Weapons, Objects and Special Objects as you like!
* Much more weapon/object/special object settings.

At the moment there is no decided name for the project yet. There have been may
suggestions for it on the LieroNet forum, but there has been no decision as
yet. The project info can also be found at the RageSquads site.

Website : http://lierosquad.cjb.net (Under the Liero 2 section)
Contact : webmaster@gliptic.com


10.3 L2
The other unofficial Liero sequel is L2. It was given this name through a poll
on the L2 Website. It began as a discussion on the old Liero Hellhole and grew
into a large project. It started out having 15 visitors a day, now it has over
250 visitors a day.

It began on the 1/7/2000. 25 days later it had had 1000 visitors. Many people
contribute demos for physics and other various parts of the game. One of these
people, Fred Alger, became one of the coders for L2 on the 25/11/2000. It then
got its name, L2, on the 8/12/200. On the 5/2/2001 the L2 Tech test was
released. 13/2/2001, the site had 20,000 hits. On the 23/3/2001 the site had
30,000 hits. 24/3/2001 L2 Liquid test was released. Then on the 12/4/2001 the
second Liquid Test is released.

You can contribute to this project by sending in your artwork, idea, etc. The
L2 project is expected to have a BETA version available by Autumn and a full
version by Christmas. And when I asked the project leader if threes anything
else he had to say on the project, he replied
'Heh, mmmm..... well, there were a lot of people that thought we would never
get anywhere, and I guess that just made me more determined :), and now we are
getting somewhere :)". - Dom Orchard

Bugs/Troubleshooting

11. Liero Bugs/Troubleshooting

11.1 Bugs
There are a few bugs in Liero. Here is all the bugs listed (so far) and how to
fix them. Thanks to Tim Verweij for telling me of these bugs

11.1 Level freezing when not enough dirt
Occasionally Liero will freeze when there is not enough dirt in a level. Simply
put more dirt in it until it works.

11.1.2 Ninja rope doing weird things
The ninja rope will occasionally do weird things when somebody walks over it,
or you try and attach it to the enemy player. Simply release the ninja rope to
fix this one.

11.1.3 Weapons jamming
The weapons will occasionally jam and continue to say loading even though it is
loaded. To fix, you will have to trade your weapon with one in a crate.

11.1.4 Runtime errors
If you have a old version of Liero and a fast computer, Liero may crash with a
Runtime error. Download the Latest version of Liero to fix this.

11.1.5 Out of screen
If you shoot a weapon with big recoil while you are against the edge of a level
(facing away from the edge), you may get 'shot' out of the level. If you
continue to shoot, you can re-appear on the other side of the level.

NEX7+

13. NEX7+

13.1 What is NEX7?
NEX7+ is a Liero-style game made in Visual Basic. It provides a different type
of play than Liero, and introduces the concept of money, a shop, and a jetpack.
You start off the game with a little money and a Auto Cannon. You get money for
shooting/killing people, and when you have enough money, you can buy a better
weapon. When you die, you drop all your weapons for other players to pick up.
You can have up to 15 bots in a game. Network and online play is currently
being developed.

13.2 Where can I get NEX7+
You can get NEX7+ on the official site at: http:\\nex7.cjb.net

Interviews
16. Interviews
Here are the interviews I gave some of the prominent members of the Liero
Community.
16.1 Tim Verweij's Interiew
Interview date : 02/05/01

Net name(s) : Aapnormaal, LoResDude (on KahnCentral)
Real name : Tim Johan Verweij
Age : 19
Gender : uuuhh, oh yes, Male :P
Languages : Dutch, English. Thats pretty much it.
Location : City: Amsterdam, Province: Noord Holland, Country: The Netherlands
Music : Metallica, Sepultura, Prodigy, Garbage, Hive, Herman van Veen
Intrests (beside Liero) : Other computer stuff, playing the recorder (thats
blokfluit in Dutch). I study Artificial Intelligence. It is quite interesting,
it includes Psychology and Language structure/semantics etc. I also like hiking
mountains (too bad we don't have them here). Sometimes I go climbing at a
climbing hall.

Durandal: When did you find out about liero?
Tim: Summer 2000

Durandal: How did you find out about liero?
Tim: I was looking for some freeware games. I ended up at freegamesweb.com
(Ingava). The site no longer exsists, but it was one of the best freeware sites
in my opinion. I believe Liero was rated *top pick*.

Durandal: What was your first game of liero like?
Tim: My first liero game was a bit dull. (Playing with the CPU) But soon after
that I was fragging my friends. ;)

Durandal: Where did you get your nick from?
Tim: I just made Aapnormaal up. I mixed Aap & abnormaal. I don't think these
words need any explaining. ;) The same for LoResDude. Maybe I'm trying to tell
ppl I like old Low-Res games.

Durandal: Whats with the picture on your profile?
Tim: The picture in my profile is a character (Tim the enchanter) from the
movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. When King Arthur and his knights meet
him Arthur asks "By what name are you known." and he answers: "There are some
who call me.... 'Tim'?" which is the text under my picture. For more
information see http://www.montypython.net

Durandal: What inspired you to you make SND Tools , LEV Tools and MB maker?
Tim: SND Tools: People were screaming for it in the Wormhole guestbook ;) Johan
Otterud said he would make a sound editor, but hey you know Johan. He doesn't
hurry up. So I made it.
I made LEV Tools because I thought I could do better than WormHole 1.0. Johan
again didn't hurry up with WH1.5 so I programmed LEV Tools.
MB Maker was actually an idea of Ulvhockey (Johan Wiklund).

Durandal: Do you have any plans for other programs?
Tim: Nothing big really. I have made aother preview maker. Its basically a
remake of LEV2BMP, but this program uses the Liero palette from LIERO.EXE and
it can make the shadows right. I may release it, but I need to find a way to
make it faster first. Actually I am making WormHole 2 together with Johan O
(I'm doing Liero hacking, he's doing all the programming). But as I said on the
messageboard he seems to be abducted by Aliens *again*.

Durandal: How do you feel to be a part of the community?
Tim: I guess if I didn't like it I would have left months ago. ;D

Durandal: What do you think of the Liero 2 sequels?
Tim: L2 looks quite promising and I am pretty sure Gliptic will do a good job
in making his Liero remake for Windows. As for all the other Liero
remakes/sequels/clones I'm not sure if they will survive.

Durandal: What do you think of NEX7+?
Tim: I don't like it that much, but maybe network play will make things better.
;)

Durandal: Are you going to be a active participant in the Liero community for a
while?
Tim: I think so, although I have been thinking about taking a break from all
Liero stuff.

Durandal: Any plans for more liero projects?
Tim: I'm setting up a new site for the Liero Level Competition. I hope
Ulvhockey will be online soon, so we can finish it and start working on the
next competition.

Durandal: Are you part of a clan?
Tim: Yes, I am member of the Terror Sabbath Clan.

Durandal: Are you good friends with other important people in the community?
Tim: I am good friends with Johan Wiklund, Johan Otterud, Sander de Jong and
Dom Orchard.

Durandal: Anything else you want to say?
Tim: Just 'Inderdaad'. Thanks.

Degauss: Well me and secret thought it was to much to do by our selves. And it
wasn't going to good for my clan anyway (I had 4 members). So we came up to a
solution; joined clans. So I'll be doing the mebers section and the downloads
sectionand secret will do the rest. But I'll also have a little bit to say
about the design.

Durandal: How many members do you have?
Degauss: Four in ManEaters. And 13 in Deathzone. That makes 17.

LieroNet forum. But I think that forum has gotten so big and messy, its hard to

completed (which may not happen), others such as Liero 2 : Liero for the next
generation don't seem to be getting anywhere, and Wurmspiel, but maybe they are
secretly. I think is LSP ever got off the ground that would be good as Gliptic
is a great coder.

Durandal :How has the community changed since it started?
Dom :It has grown incredibly, when I came into the community in 1999 there
weren't many people, and there were only a couple of liero sites, but now I
know of over 100 sites, and that's the ones I know of, there is a massive
gathering now, probably as many as 1000-2000 liero fans. It has been nice seing
all the websites start and grow, like Lieronet and Liero Hell Hole.

Durandal :Can you give a bit of background on L2?
Dom :Well... in June 2000 on message board at the site that is now called Liero
Hell Hole a few of us fans (including MPEG4 i think, who i think went on to try
to set up his own Liero 2 project) were talking about who annoying it was that
a new version of Liero would not occur. We then decided that maybe we should
make our own sequel, with a main central website where everyone can pull
together over the internet, and so on July the 1st 2000 at 19:02 GMT 0:00 the
Liero 2 era was born with the launch or http://members.tripod.co.uk/liero2/ At
first about 15 visitors turned up every day, then on the 4th day that shot up
to 125, I was amazed. From there it grew and grew, not after long
http://liero2.web.com appeared as a shorted address, but that has now
dissapeared and gone to http://liero2.com

Durandal :How soons it expected?
Dom :Fully working BETA by autumn, fully polished with all bugs ironed out by
the end of the year, hopefully.

Durandal :Any big changes over Liero?
Dom :Internet, Network, more players, skins on players, now in Windows
platform, better graphics, sound, missions, faster speeds, higher
compatibility, etc.

Durandal :What do you think of NEX7+?
Dom :I think it is great fun and very enjoyable, but it is not quite the same
as Liero.

Durandal :Are you going to be a active participant in the Liero community for a
while?
Dom :Maybe as long as I am alive ;) who knows, I have been in it for about 2
years, and hopefully I have a lot more time to go in the age of L2 and Liero 2

Durandal :Are you part of a clan?
Dom :Yes, Terror Sabbath

Durandal :Are you good friends with other important people in the community?
Dom :Yeah, Johan Otterud, Tim Verweij, Ulvhockey and Shiva, I do talk to
Gliptic sometimes, and occasionaly (but not much now) I talk to Joosa on ICQ.

Durandal :Anything else you want to say?
Dom :I hope everyone can continue working hard in the Liero community, and I
hope that it will prosper and grow bigger and bigger.

Durandal : When did you find out about liero?
Gliptic : It was in 1999 I think

Durandal : How did you find out about liero?
Gliptic : A friend of mine said he got a really cool game. I forced him to send
it to me and I got stuck in it!

Durandal : What was your first game of liero like?
Gliptic : You mean the first time I played Liero? It was pretty annoying since
I didn't know how to dig and use the ninja rope.

Durandal : Where did you get your nick from?
Gliptic : From empty space... I don't know really. It just popped up in my
head.

fun when you have played for a couple of hours.

a while?
Gliptic : I don't know actually. I have alot to do, but I will visit the
LieroNet board at least once a day :-D.

Gliptic : I'm the clanleader of my own clan! (RageSquad)

Forum FAQ
17 Forum FAQ
This is a section on how to use, behave and enjoy the Liero Forum. This is
recommended reading for everyone, not just newbies. This is not going to be an
in-depth FAQ, just some things that need to be adhered to.
17.1 General use
17.1.1 Login
Login is case-sensitive. I decided to put this in because it caught me out.
17.1.2 Posting
Here are the ins and outs of posting:

In's
You should only post on-topic.
You should keep it to the point.
You should use names if replying to someone in particular.
You should try to keep your criticisim as constructive as possible
Outs
You shouldnt quote a post when you are directly beneath it.
You shouldnt use uppercase the whole quote.
You shouldnt use large fonts the whole quote.
You shouldnt attack somebody. If you want to have an argument/heated
duscussion, Private message them or E-Mail them


17.1.3 New threads
You shouldnt start new threads without first checking that your post hasnt
already been covered and that it is a worthwile topic. New threads push the
other ones down, and if there is an important thread followed by a lot of
unimportant ones the people who are trying to have a important conversation
will get quite annoyed.

17.1.4 Avitars/Pictures
You should keep you Avitar (the pic under your name) something kids can see.
The forum has young teenagers in it.

17.1.5 Swearing
Again as above, keeping swearing under control. The odd word isnt bad here and
there, but dont push it too much.

17.1.6 Spamming
Dont do it. If you do, you will be found and you will be banned.

17.1.7 Moderators
Some people of the community are what is called moderators. They have access to
functions that other users dont, like locking topics, deleting posts etc. They
help keep spammers out and good posts in. You should speak to one of these
people if you need help. They should be friendly and helpfull.

Conclusion
18. Conclusion
Well, its time to end this guide for this version. Whew, it hasn’t been easy,
with chasing up people. Funny thing is, I’ve always been a failure at English
and always been good at science. And here I am, not making a utility for Liero,
but writing this Guide. I’ve had a bit of help from the odd person here or
there, which I greatly appreciate. I have also learnt a LOT about the Liero
community, I started off not knowing anything, and now know who owns what
Website, and who will actually respond to messages from some guy talking about
some guide. And the weapon guide was loooong. Its short to read, but long to
make, with all the values I had to get. Tell me about your web-site, Mods,
programs, etc. and keep sending in. Its free advertisement.
18.1 Thanks
My thanks go out to

Johan Wiklund : For the interest, for info on his clan and proof-reading
Sander de Jong : For putting up with my constant questions
Tim Verweij : For answering my technical questions
YH : For proof-reading and pointing out errors, etc.
Killer Worm : For the LieroGuide logo

18.2 Contact
You can contact me at nallan@hotkey.net.au. Submit info I have left out, your
Website, Mods, stuff, anything you want. You can also contact me on ICQ :
