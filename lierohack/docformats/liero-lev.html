<h3>Liero level (LEV) file format</h3>
The Liero level format is actually quite easy. Liero level files do not contain a header of any kind.
The dimensions of a Liero level are 504*350. Each byte in the level file corresponds to a pixel in the level.
So level files should always be 504*350=176400 bytes in size. Levels made by WormHole however are 176402 bytes in size.
Because of a small bug in the program, these levels include a DOS end of line (0Dh 0Ah) at the end of the file.<br>
<br>
The values in the Liero level files are used as a color index number and as a material index number in the game.
