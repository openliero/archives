<h3>Liero sound (SND) file format</h3>
The file starts with a Word that represents the number of sound effects in the file. Because Liero
will most likely never support more than 30 sounds this Word is always set to 1Eh 00h (=30 decimal).<br>
<br>
After that there is a special entry for all 30 sound effects in this order:<br>
SHOTGUN, SHOT, RIFLE, BAZOOKA, BLASTER, THROW, LARPA, EXP3A, EXP3B, EXP2, EXP3,
EXP4, EXP5, DIRT, BUMP, DEATH1, DEATH2, DEATH3, HURT1, HURT2, HURT3, ALIVE, BEGIN,
DROPSHEL, RELOADED, MOVEUP, MOVEDOWN, SELECT, BOING, BURNER.<br>
I'm not sure if this order is compulsory, but why change it?<br>
<br>
Each entry consists of:<br>
- The sound effect name filled up with null bytes to get exactly 8 bytes.<br>
- A DWord indicating the beginning (offset) of the sound effect in the file.<br>
- Another DWord indicating the length of the sound effect in bytes.<br>
<br>
So the header is (8+4+4)*30 = 480 bytes. 482 bytes including the first 2 bytes. After the header the
sound data begins. The sound Liero uses is 8-bit PCM signed mono @22050 Hz.<br>
<br>
There are a few more interesting things to know about the Liero SND:
<ul>
    <li>The original sound file has some annoying clicks/pops at the beginnig and/or the end of some sound
        effects. It may be a good idea to chop off the first and last few bytes of each sound when dealing
        with the original sound file. (Liero SND Tools does this too).</li>
    <li>Sound effects can be completely disabled by setting both the starting offset and the length of the
        sound effect to zero.</li>
    <li>The same piece of sound data can be used for more than one sound effect. In other words, they can
        have exactly the same starting offset and length. It is also possible for sounds to partially
        overlap.</li>
</ul>
