<h3>JASC Palette (PAL) file format</h3>
By Sander de Jong<br>

<br>
There are two PAL file formats. The first one is the MicroSoft PAL file, used in PhotoShop and Paintshop Pro. LieroKit also supports them, but I don't know how these palettes work.
The second one is the JASC PAL file, used by Paintshop Pro. This file works a lot easier, so both LieroKit and LieroM8 support them (LieroM8 not completely right now).<br>
<br>
This file works like this: The PAL file is a text file, so NO binary data.<br>
The first line of data contains the text 'JASC-PAL', leave it this way.<br>
The second line contains the text '0100', don't know what this means, just leave it like this.<br>
The third line contains the text '256'. This is the number of colors in the palette, most likely 256 colors for use with Liero.<br>
<br>
After that, there are 256 lines of text, containing 3 numbers per line, with spaces between them.<br>
These numbers are respectively the Red, Green and Blue values (the so-called RGB palette). For example, the color white would be '255 255 255' and black '0 0 0' (255 is the most bright, 0 the less bright)<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that Liero doesn't use 8-bit (256) palette values, but 6-bit (64)! This means you will have to devide the color by 4 if you want to store the value to Liero.Exe, and multiply by 4 to retrieve the colors in Liero.Exe !!!<br>
