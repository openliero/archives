<h3>Liero options (LIERO.OPT) file format</h3>
This file is the most boring of all. It's only purpose is to tell Liero which DAT file to load at startup.
The filename is given without the DAT extension. By default this file only includes:<br>
<br>
LIERO<br>
<br>
Which tells Liero to use 'LIERO.DAT'.<br>
<br>
I just discovered this does not work at all for me. Liero always loads LIERO.DAT.
Maybe this is a bug in Liero? Can anyone confirm this? Please e-mail me. The command line option '/o' doesn't seem
to work either. :(
