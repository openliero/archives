<h3>Liero graphics (CHR) file format</h3>
By Sander de Jong<br>
http://lieronet.cjb.net<br>
<br>
The CHR file format is very simple. It is raw data, meaning there is no sort of compression or whatsoever.
The first 10 bytes of the CHR file is the header. The first 5 bytes of it is the word 'LIERO'. Byte 6-10 are the bytes 00 02 10 10 6E. Nobody knows what these values mean, but just keep them this way.<br>
<br>
After that, the real picture comes. This is devided in 3 parts: a part of 16 pixels wide and 1760 high, then a part of 7 pixels wide and 910 high and the third part is 4 pixels wide and 120 high.<br>
This data is stored right after each other, no breaks. So, in short:<br>
<br>
Header, 10 bytes<br>
Picture 1, 16x1760 pixels<br>
Picture 2,  7x910  pixels<br>
Picture 3,  4x120  pixels<br>
<br>
The values of the pixels are the same as in the Liero palette, color 0 is transparent.<br>
<br>
That's all! Now you know how the CHR file works. Hope I helped enough.
