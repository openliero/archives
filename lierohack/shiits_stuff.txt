I've been reading Tim Verweij's Liero Hacking Project, and I've come around two
variables he hadn't identified yet. Well, I've identified them, but they're
completely illogical! Why would Joossa do such a strange thing?
Is he out of his mind?

Where, what and what they do:
They are both properties of what LieroKit calls "Map changes"
variable 1: 0001C1F4h to 0001C1FCh
variable 2: 0001C1FEh to 0001C206h

Well, the first variable is the texture the map change will leave behind.
The second is the amount of textures to use. Now, this would be logical if Liero
had many textures, but there are only 3 useable! That's just plain wack! You can
choose a texture from the "large" 16x16 sprites at the beginning of each bmp-ed
graphics mod, but the only textures that ordinary Liero uses are the strange
text sprites that say: "ddM" or "dTvM". Now, if we mirror these sprites,
they say: "Maa" and "Muta" and "Wiek ka". (Not sure about the last one)
Now these are probably Finnish words, so they're of no meaning to me. These
sprites do seem to have meaning. The one labeled "Muta" looks like greenball
dirt in-game. The one labeled "Maa" looks like background and the one that looks
somewhat like "Wiek ka" looks like dirtball dirt. But still, it would be very
illogical and weird to have 6 (there are 2 of each sprite) special textures, and
put them among the other sprites and make them have mysterious text on them,
right? Anybody have ANY idea what this means? And, if there's a way to add or
modify these textures?

Shiit you guessed right. those are finnish words. "maa" means earth,
"muta" means mud, "wiek ka" doesn't mean anything but "hiekka" means sand.
