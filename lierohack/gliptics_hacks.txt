            Hello, Tim!

Here are some really good Liero.exe hacks. I'm writing them with this
layout (you probably remember but I write it again to make sure):

[B|W|D][s] offset - Description (default value)

B - Byte
W - Word
D - DWORD
s - Signed

Here are the hacks:

*** Value - hacks are in the Liero offset list ***

*** Here are some other things you can try if you are bored ***

/// Negative worm gravity ///

B 0x00003BDC - Change to 6Dh (45h)
B 0x00003BE2 - Change to 5Dh (55h)
Note! Both values must be changed to make it correct.

The same can be made with the other gravity settings. For example, the
gravity on bonuses is located at 72C3. Subtract 2 from that number and you
will get the address of the first value (address: 72C1) which should be
changed to 6Dh. Take the gravity on bonuses address again and now add 4 to
it and you will get the second value (address: 72C7) which should be
changed to 5Dh. Here are the values this method can be used on:

* Worm gravity
* Gravity on bonuses
* Secondary blood gravity
* Vertical gravity on the ninjarope

It can also be used with jump force/speed but the values should be changed
to 45h and 55h instead (The original values is in this case 6Dh and 5Dh).

/// Removing the one-press-one-jump checking code ///

W 0x0000331B - Change to hex:EB06 (hex:2680)

This makes Liero skip the one-press-one-jump checking code. This hack
makes the worms able to jump all the time by holding down the jump key.

------

/// Removing the check-if-on-ground-when-jumping code ///

W 0x00003313 - Change to hex:EB06 (hex:2680)

This can be used to make a vertical jetpak just like in Nex7+.

Here are some interesting code offsets:

0x00002237 - Generate random level procedure
0x0000285C - Procedure that handles the worms
0x000073A6 - Handles a specified object
0x0000A09D - The loop that handles objects in the game (calls 0x000073A6
for each object)
0x0000A7F9 - Applies force to the worms from the ninja rope
0x0001145F - Palette output procedure
0x00011755 - Wait for vertical retrace
0x00016318 - Keyboard interupt handler
0x0001AB94 - Procedure that generates random numbers
