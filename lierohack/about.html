<h3>About</h3>
Liero is a very customizable game. Almost everything can be changed: Levels, graphics, sounds weapons,
fonts, palettes, CPU settings. My goal is now to make a complete reference to all that can be changed.
Big parts of the offset list came from 'research' done by me and Johan Otterud. Because Johan Otterud didn't
reply to my e-mails for a long time, I decided to upload the list, so everyone could use it. If you
have any additions or corrections, please send them to me and I will upload it. Document format descriptions
are also welcome. Anyone sending in useful information will be listed in the credits section.<br>
<br>
I know there are a lot of Liero fans who have the skills to make a liero editor, but don't know
enough about Liero itself. Now they get a chance too. If you use any information from this website,
please include credits to the author(s) of the documents used in your program.<br>
